If the glot-snippet container is getting terminnated always after few secs (probably 10-12 sec) the the issue is the IP address that 
we are giving for connection with couchdb in the Env variable file and if we are having AWS env i faced this because i was mapping Elastic IP 
of server with couch db port which when i'm running snippet container somehow it's not able to connect with couchDB server with this IP so 
we have to connect with the Internal IP address of server to resolve this issue. I also tested it by conneting it with container internal IP
of couchDb which we can check by inspecting couchDB container but in my point of view this container IP can change as we are using compose file
to run all containers at once. so we should connect couchDB with internal IP of instance like we did in docker domain settings for glot.
